# Luci heals more - a mod for RimWorld

This mod changes how Luciferium heals. 
The healing event occurs more often, every 4-6 days, but it is less powerful (no instaheal of a wound, but percent heal).

## New features: 
* healing of all vanila chronic conditions like bad back and frail.
* reversed aging: every 4-6 days your colonists will get younger until optimal age of 25. Also works on animals.
* accelerated maturity to 3rd stage in animals or 25 years in humans.
* buff 10 % to hearing, so that all your stats are increased.
